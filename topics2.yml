        description: '

          The relatively simple calculation of the Aerosol Index is based on wavelength
          dependent changes in Rayleigh scattering in the UV spectral range where
          ozone absorption is very small. UVAI can also be calculated in the presence
          of clouds so that daily, global coverage is possible. This is ideal for
          tracking the evolution of episodic aerosol plumes from dust outbreaks, volcanic
          ash, and biomass burning.

      Glaciers are masses of land ice, formed by the further recrystallization of
      firn, flowing continuously from higher to lower elevations. Ice sheets are a
      continuous sheet of land ice that covers a very large area and moves outward
      in many directions. This type of ice mass is so thick as to mask the land surface
      contours, in contrast to the smaller and thinner highland ice. The continental
      glacier of Greenland is sometimes called the Inland Ice. This term is often
      used to describe the great ice masses that characterized the ice ages.
