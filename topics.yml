    \ are critical for life to exist. It distributes incoming solar radiation, protecting\
    \ life from harmful ultraviolet radiation but also driving atmospheric circulation\
    \ and weather. The atmosphere enables the greenhouse effect, which makes Earth\
    \ more habitable. Human activity, however, is contributing more gases, many of\
    \ which are negatively impacting the protective nature of this vital layer. NASA\
    \ data provide measurements on weather phenomena as well as gases within the troposphere\

        the prevailing west to northwest winds of summer have been called the European
        monsoon. The primary cause is the much greater annual variation of temperature
        over large land areas compared with neighboring ocean surfaces, causing an
        excess of pressure over the continents in winter and a deficit in summer,
        but other factors such as the relief features of the land have a considerable

        the Earths surface such as when dams are created to control flooding (perhaps
        due to more deforested and overgrazed slopes), (2) pollution control, when
        decisions are made to minimize the chemicals, such as fertilizers, pesticides,
        or road salt, that are used on the soil surface in order to minimize the amount
        of pollutants that will leach into the soil, and (3) amount and quality of
        water available for human use as when water is used for irrigation, industry

        dead zone, hypoxia can also kill marine organisms which cannot escape the

        ecosystems. 3. Rationale: Numerous researchers are studying hypoxia, the hypoxic
        zone, and its effect on fisheries. It is becoming a highly visible hot topic
        in the Gulf of Mexico and other regions as the onset of hypoxia is largely
        due to increased nutrient run off from agriculture practices in the Mississippi
